# BetterSharpForUnity

BetterSharpForUnity provides a foundation for developing with C#10 or C#11 in Unity.

## Caution!

This library is currently under development and subject to destructive changes.

## Supported Unity versions

Unity 2022.3 or newer

## How to Install

Add the following line to manifest.json

```json
"com.github-troubear.bettersharpforunity": "https://github.com/troubear/BetterSharpForUnity.git?path=Packages/BetterSharpForUnity",
```

Or, install from `Package Manager` -> `Add package from git URL...`

## How to use the new C#

### C#10

#### Apply to the specified assembly:

1. Create `csc.rsp` in the same folder as `*.asmdef`
2. Add `-langVersion:10` to `csc.rsp`

### C#11 (2022.3.12+)

Just change `-langVersion:10` to `-langVersion:preview`.

## APIs

### BetterSharp.Assertions

Provides a compatible subset API of `UnityEngine.Assertions.Assert` that leverages C#10 functionality.

- `Assert.IsTrue`
- `Assert.IsFalse`

#### Features

- String interpolation of message is performed only if the assertion fails. You don't have to be afraid of GC anymore.
- Assertion expressions are output to the log as strings. Good news for all you lazy people.
-  These methods can benefit from static code analysis as well as [System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.debug.assert)
